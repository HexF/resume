In the early 2000s, attempting to deploy a Jabber server at my [first employer](/#experience), I needed a user manual for the Windows (95!) jabber client I wanted the users to use (_not that any of them actually **read** the manual!_)

Jabber clients were scarce back then (_[Psi](https://psi-im.org/) and [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) were not available yet_), and a ICQ-like Russian client named [JAJC](http://jajc.jrudevels.org/) was one of the most power and flexible clients.

I co-operated with the lead developer at the time to produce an "official" manual in Docbook XML V4. The original XML is sadly lost (_not that I'd ever want to do that again!_), but the PDF-rendered version is [available here](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/images/jajc_manual.pdf).
