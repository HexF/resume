In 2018 (published 2019), I was approached by @RockSteady to participate in a series of interviews published on the TurtleCoin blog, highlighting members of the community, or promoting smaller "niche" mining pools.

Turns out Mr Steady is a fan of Kubernetes himself, and we discuss about how I became involved in TurtleCoin, building mining pools, micro-services, and transition to Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook and my love of building "geeky" stuff :)
