In 2008, I wrote a [WP-PHPlist](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/project/wp-phplist/), a Wordpress plugin to integrate [phpList](https://www.phplist.org/) signup/preferences forms with Wordpress, and maintained it across several phpList versions, supporting users in the phpList forums.

As a result, I was approached in 2011 by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/), to co-author a technical manual covering phpList in-depth. When my co-author failed to deliver, I was asked to author the entire book, a task which took several months of working alternate weekends, to complete.

The [resulting book was published](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/phplist-2-e-mail-campaign-manager) a few months before a major retheming of phpList, which ultimately became phpList 3. (I still have 5 copies on my bookshelf!)

Here's the blurb:
