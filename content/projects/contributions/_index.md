<p>Whenever possible, I like to contribute back to open source projects I come across. Sometimes my only contribution is a [typo in a README](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-pool/pull/11), but as a maintainer of my own projects, I know that every little contribution boots my motivation to keep working on the (volunteer) project!</p>
