Wanting to learn more about cryptocurrency / blockchain, and to watch a currency grow from infancy, I've become involved as a contributor to TurtleCoin. My first project has been the establishment of the only (as far as I know) NZ-based mining pool for TurtleCoin.

I plan to follow this up with NZ mining pools for other popular coins.
