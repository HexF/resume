In the late 1990s, in my final years of high school, I started collecting christian inspirational stories and poems (think "[Footprints in the sand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprints_%28poem%29)"), and distributing them to an email mailing list.

In 2000, my interest in coding / publishing (_and my vast amounts of free time!_) led me to build a CMS system, (_PHP, mySQL, hosted with Dreamhost_) to display and categorise this content, eventually gaining 20,000+ daily subscribers, with 900+ individual posts.

In many cases, I secured the original author's consent to republish their stories. I developed a tagging system, printable/palmpilot versions of stories, subscription management, and an admin interface which drove it all.

Building "_Coffee In The Rain_" was a labour of love, which took significant amounts of personal time, and gave me a foundation in PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and fostered a love of writing and publishing.

Eventually my site was dwarfed by bigger, funded (_and more experienced_) content providers, including  [eGroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGroups), who brought me in originally as an affiliated premium content partner. The partnership was cancelled when Yahoo! acquired eGroups (_now Yahoo! Groups_). I became too busy to maintain the site myself (_it took several hours per day to manage_), and so I eventually lost interest in adding fresh content, and left it online as a collection of static content.

I (_regrettably_) allowed the coffeeintherain.com domain to lapse, and ever since it's been held by a domain squatter. The original interface and content can still be found using the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20010202170000/http://www.coffeeintherain.com:80/team), but I'm sorry to say that I also lost / discarded all my original source code and data.
